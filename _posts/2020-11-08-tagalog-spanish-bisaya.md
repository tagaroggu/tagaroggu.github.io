title: A note on Tagalog, Spanish, and Bisaya
---
Although my grandmother is Filipino, I cannot speak Bisaya or Tagalog. I've been trying to learn the both of them, and even thought I barely know anything in either one, I guess I could say a few things on them. Firstly, they are so difficult for me to understand. When I was *trying* to learn Japanese, I did eventually pick up on the pattern and could adapt my limited knowledge to make new sentences, but with Bisaya and Tagalog, I feel there is a steeper learning curve. I'm also trying to learn them while I soak up a lot of Spanish, which I thought would make learning Tagalog and Bisaya easier, since a decent amount of the vocabulary of each come from Spanish, but it hasn't, for me. I find that the sentence structure catches me at a blind side becausae when I think that I'm understanding it, something comes up that throws me completely off. Honestly, I love these languages, they're a part of who my grandma is, and I want them to be a part of me, but they're so difficult.
